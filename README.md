# views
Probably the most simple analytics system. It just counts how many views you have.

This might have been one of my first Express projects and projects with a database. When this was created, I was having issues with a bug where the database timed out after 20 minutes of not using it. That is why there seems to be some unnecessary code to restart the app when there is an error.

## Testing
This is used on https://binz.now.sh and to view the view count you can head to https://plastic-khaan.glitch.me/count.
